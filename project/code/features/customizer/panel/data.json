If your part is newly manufactured and has no prior coating, selecting the \"Newly Manufactured\" option allows us to apply the most efficient and cost-effective preparation process. On the other hand, if your part already has a coating applied or shows signs of rust or paint, selecting the \"Coated\" option helps us assess the additional steps required to achieve the desired finish. This ensures that your part receives the proper treatment for optimal powder coating results."
