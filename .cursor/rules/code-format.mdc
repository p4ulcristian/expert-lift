I prefer small functions for better readability. Comments in clojure are after the function name, before the parameter list. No unnecessary changes, ask first.
in clojure, filenames are underscored, while the namespaces are dashed.
defresolver is a macro, and it expects a map as it's returning value, it cannot be a function call.
careful with hugsql, don't make overlapping functions with the calling namespace.
