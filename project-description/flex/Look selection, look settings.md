This is the screen users see when they want to:

- Opt out of accepting orders for certain looks

- See properties of a look

- Adjust specific powders associated with looks. This is so that for
  example if they use a different brand black to achieve a black look
  shown in the customizer, they have the option to change the default
  "powders to achieve look" settings of looks.

- Put looks on sale (offer discounts on orders for specific looks)

The screen is a list of all color options

## Questions / ideas

- We should display the date and time the list was last centrally
  updated, so they can know if there are new looks or not.
